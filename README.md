#Where Is My Bus #
A crowdsourced BMTC (Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation) Bus Spotting Application

##Motivation
While waiting for a bus, it is a common experience to see many other buses go by. Using our application, you can report the buses that you have seen pass by, and find buses that others have seen. Who knows, maybe someone else would have spotted the bus you're waiting for!
