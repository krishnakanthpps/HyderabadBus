<p>A crowdsourced BMTC (Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation) Bus Spotting Application inspired application designed by students from IIIT. I converted their app to meet my requirements which would cater to all of public transport facilities in Hyderabad, the RTC bus, the MMTS train and even can support the upcoming Metro as well. </p>

<h2>
<a id="motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h2>

<p>The original motivation by the IIIT guys in designing their app : 
While waiting for a bus, it is a common experience to see many other buses go by. Using our application, you can report the buses that you have seen pass by, and find buses that others have seen. Who knows, maybe someone else would have spotted the bus/train you're waiting for!</p>

<h3>
<a id="my-motivation" class="anchor" href="#my-motivation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Motivation</h3>

<p>I find that people waste a lot of time waiting for their transport not knowing when it would come and where it is stuck. And this makes people go for private transport which in turn increases the number of vehicles on road and thus more traffic jams and more pollution. </p>

<p>If people had a way to find exactly where their transport is or if it was possible to know how much time it might take for their transport to reach, they can take smarter decisions and also be able to use their wasted time. </p>

<p>This app is designed to allow people using public transport, take smart decisions and travel smartly with much hassle.</p>
